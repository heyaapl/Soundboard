# Soundboard for WoW

**Play sounds and emotes in World of Warcraft**

Soundboard lets you play sound effects and perform emotes using slash commands or a minimap button. Share sounds with your party, raid, or guild members who also have the addon.

Updated version of the classic "Gag" addon, rewritten for all Classic and Retail WoW versions with modern features like automatic event triggers and personal blocklist controls.

## What it does

*   **Play 480+ sounds** from movies, games, music, and memes
*   **Share with friends** - Party/raid/guild members hear your sounds
*   **Automatic emotes** - Your character dances, cheers, etc. with sounds
*   **Smart events system** - Sounds can trigger automatically on game events
*   **Personal blocklist** - Block annoying sounds while keeping perfect timing
*   **Simple commands** - Type `/hero` or use the minimap menu
*   **Volume control** - Adjust sound levels in settings

## How to use

**Quick start:** Click the minimap button to browse sounds or type `/[soundname]` to play specific sounds

**Examples:**

*   `/hero` - Plays "I need a hero"
*   `/win` - Victory sound
*   `/rickroll` - Classic meme sound
*   `/literally` - Parks & Rec "LITERALLY trying!"
*   `/ew-david` - Schitt's Creek classic

## New Features

### ðŸš« Blocklist System
Take control of your sound experience:
*   **Block any sound** - Click the X next to sounds you don't want to hear
*   **Smart timing** - Blocked sounds still respect queue timing (no disruption!)
*   **No spam** - Blocked sounds won't trigger emotes or chat messages
*   **Personal choice** - Everyone blocks sounds they don't like
